##Why?

Becuase Elon Musk belives humans need to become a mutli planetry species as over a long period of time just staying on Earth is a risk. 

##How?

Within the last year SpaceX has reached an amazing milestone in succcessfully devloping reuseable spacecraft. Taking this forward they have designed a spacecraft capable of taknig humans and cargo to Mars to establish a colony. 

Here is a great write up about it on the wonderful Wait But Why - http://waitbutwhy.com/2016/09/spacexs-big-fking-rocket-the-full-story.html

And there is also more on the SpaceX website.

Random Thought: Did Elon build Tesla cars to be so fast so more humans will be more comfortable with the g forces experienced in space travle!?
